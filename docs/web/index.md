## Targets User Guide

> Note: This site is still a very early draft. The [MVHS-specific](mvhs/index.html) docs are more complete, but they're designed for one school only, and even they need revision.

This site contains various documents describing the installation and use of
[Targets](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/targets).

Targets is an assignment manager and simple autograder intended primarily for
high school computer science courses. It is written in [Dart](https://dartlang.org) and should work on any modern machine running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
