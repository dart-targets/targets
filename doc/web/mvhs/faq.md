#### Who Am I? ####

My name is [Jack Thakar](https://jackthakar.com). I'm currently a freshman studying computer science at UC Berkeley. I graduated from Monte Vista last June. I took VS.net (back when it was still taught in Visual Basic) and AP Java with Mrs. Anwar my freshman and sophomore years and then was a tutor for AP Java as a senior. I also founded Android Club, which may or may not still exist.

#### Why Am I Writing Targets? ####

I decided to write Targets after seeing how difficult it was to grade programming assignments while I was a tutor for AP Java. Testing student code wasn't even the worst part (though Targets does make this better). Even when we required submissions in a certain format (zip file, Word doc, etc.), there would always be multiple people that submitted it differently.

Targets ensures that everyone works from a common template and allows batch downloading and testing once final solutions have been submitted. Universities already have a wide variety of tools for grading software, such that even 1500+ student classes like Berkeley's [CS 61A](http://cs61a.org) can run smoothly. Targets, on the other hand, is designed for high schools, where CS classes don't have the benefit of a 50+ person course staff.

If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or bug reports regarding Targets, I've set up an email specifically for MVHS [here](mailto:mvhstargets@jackthakar.com).
